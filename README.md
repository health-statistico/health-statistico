## Hi there ðŸ‘‹


<!--**health-statistico/health-statistico** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.**-->
I am a health economist currently learning to use the following languages for health economics outcomes research:
- R
- VBA for Excel
- Stata

I hope in future to add the following to my repertoire:
- SAS
- Shell scripting languages (powershell & bash)

This is my personal code repository, but feel free to use any code posted here publicly as you wish :)
